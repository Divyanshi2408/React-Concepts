# React Virtual DOM

React's Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. It helps optimize UI rendering by updating only the parts of the DOM that need changes.

## How It Works
1. **Initial Rendering:** The Virtual DOM mirrors the real DOM.
2. **State Changes:** React updates the Virtual DOM first.
3. **Diffing Algorithm:** React calculates the minimal changes needed.
4. **DOM Update:** The real DOM is updated efficiently.

## Why It Matters
- **Performance:** Faster updates to the user interface.
- **Efficiency:** Minimal manipulation of the actual DOM.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly across web and mobile platforms.
